# Yet another platformer (Modded)

This is a **modded version** of the original [Moddable-platformer](https://github.com/endlessm/moddable-platformer/) by the [Endless OS Foundation](https://endlessos.org).
The project has been enhanced with new audio, visuals, and small polish improvements while keeping the original gameplay intact.
